Question - Has anyone named their kid after technology?
Answer - 
A couple, Ela Karina and Andi Chaya Saputra, in Indonessia, had their pregnancy coming up to the due date.
They could not decide on the name, and then, after the baby was born, they decided to just name the baby Google.
The idea was that, by naming the baby Google it would bestow some type of prosperous future on the child.
It will be interesting to see when a job application is sent to Google by an applicant named Google. I'd wager he at least get a call.

Question - In a TCS interview, the interviewer asked, "If you were given a choice to choose between a job offer from Google and TCS, what would you choose?" 
           What is the best way to answer this question that can impress the TCS interviewer?
Answer - 
More than the company brand, what matters is:

1) The role
2) What are the next steps up from that role
3) How well you are both excited and have strength for that
4) The people you work with
5) The location
6) The salary
Get a clarity on these parameters. As an extreme example, a VP role in TCS might be a better choice than a SDE at Google. 
This is a good opportunity to know more about what you will be working on.

Question - What is the reason behind India losing in the 3rd ODI against New Zealand?
Answer - 
Poor opening — batting and bowling.
In the entire series, neither of the 2 openers scored a half-century and often got out in single digits.
Even in the first ODI when nearly 700 runs were scored on a flat pitch with small boundaries, the openers could not make a mark.
That exposed Virat Kohli who had to come too soon to the crease and failed a couple of times. 
In a high scoring series where 300s are easily chased, Kohli averaged 25.00. A very poor series for a person of his caliber.
Without Kohli’s big runs and Rohit Sharma [who is injured] Indian batting doesn’t stand much of a chance.
To make matters worse India’s ace bowler Bumrah turned wicketless in the entire series and going nearly 6 runs per over. 
Very unusual. Saini,his fast bowling mate didn’t take any wickets in the last 2 games and that makes the opening fast bowlers inept. Thakur took a couple of wickets, but was going nearly 8 runs a over.
In retrospect, team selection was poor — putting an inexperienced opening and bowling combination and a lot of stress on just 2 superstars — Kohli and Bumrah.
Without a good top order and good fast bowling, the fact that India came this close in all 3 matches in itself a miracle — mostly owed to the middle order that suddenly came to work in full force after mostly vacationing the last couple of years.

Question - Prime Video buys rights of a movie for 20 crores and a viewer watches that movie with a membership costing only Rs.1000 per year. Prime has multiple movies and the viewer has only one membership. 
           Where does this math make sense?
Answer - 
Amazon plays the long game and its investors are fairly patient. 
India’s Prime subscription is already over 1 crore (10 million) and they are planning to get to 10 crores in 5 years.
To achieve that objective it is not outrageous to pay Rs 20 crores for a blockbuster movie. Only if you have top shows you will find the Prime Video worth it.
They could buy rights to 100 such blockbusters and Bezos would gladly write a check for $280m — it is a trillion dollar company and sees India among its 4 key initiatives for the decade. Anyway, not all shows and movies fetch this price.
Once you get hooked on to their services, they are going to increase the prices quite a lot with monopoly and are also going to make you buy a lot more of their services.
They are basically getting you on to a gateway drug that will get you deeper and deeper into their system.

Question -  How do you activate screen mirroring on a Samsung TV?
Answer - 
1) There is an app built in to the TV, you can cast to that
2) You can use a streaming device, such as a Roku. Roku (and I’m sure others) has a casting app. Plug the streaming device in to your TV. You can cast to it plus you get tons of free channels plus pay channels as well. Many more than come with the TV.
3) You can use Google Chrome cast. Plug it in to your TV.
Each app should show up using a network search. So you use, say, Google cast and it should display whatever app you’ve chosen.

Question - What is a commercial litigator?
Answer - 
A litigator is an attorney who specializes in litigation, but within that general classification, there are a number of sub-categories, such as family law, personal injury, patent/trademark, securities issues, and my own specialty - disputes between borrowers and lenders. 
The longer an attorney practices, the more they tend to specialize. There’s just too much to learn and do to generalize.
A “commercial” litigator is someone who tries cases involving debt collection or inter-business disputes of one sort or another. 
I’ve heard the term used to describe different types of business-business disputes, whereas mine was generally business-bank disputes.
